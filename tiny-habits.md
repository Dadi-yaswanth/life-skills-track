## Tiny Habits by BJ Fogg - Core Message
#### 2. Your takeaways from the video in as much detail as possible
My takeaways from the video is :
The formula for human behavior is: B = MAP (Behavior equals Motivation, Ability, and Prompt). 
 When developing a new habit, such as reading a book before bed, you will engage in the habit if your motivation to read aligns with your ability to access a book and dedicate time to your reading goal, prompted by reminders or seeing a book nearby.
 By simply following the "Tiny Habits Method," anyone can hack the universal behavior model. Here's how: </br> </br>
#### Part #1: Shrink the Behavior** 
When a task is challenging, you require a significant level of motivation to surpass the "action line" and successfully accomplish the task. </br>
Fogg said to make habits really small, so you don't need to rely on motivation. To find the smallest version of a habit, you can either do less of it or just start with the first step.

#### Part #2: Identify an action prompt

</br>
There are three types of habit reminders:
- External/context prompts: These are cues from your surroundings, like sticky notes, phone notifications, and alarms.

- Internal prompts (also called personal prompts): These are thoughts and sensations that remind you to take action, such as a growling stomach.

- Action prompts: These occur when completing one behavior triggers the next behavior. For example, loading the dishwasher can prompt you to clean the kitchen countertops.


#### Part #3: Grow Your Behavior with Some Shine

"Shine" is the term BJ Fogg used to describe the feeling of accomplishment. It's like authentic pride. To sustain and grow your habits, you need to feel Shine after completing even the tiniest version of a habit. Celebrating these small wins is crucial for habit development. By regularly experiencing Shine, your motivation will increase, allowing you to take on more challenging habits.

#### 3. How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier?
The B=MAP model highlights three simple variables that drive behaviors.
- Invest time in researching and learning more about the habit you want to develop.
- Obtain tools and resources that can assist you in practicing and mastering the new habit.
- Make the behavior incredibly small and manageable, breaking it down into its tiniest version.
- 
#### 4. Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit?
Celebrating when you remember to do your habit helps reinforce the memory of that moment. This is crucial because if you forget to do the habit, you won't be able to do it. Another occasion to celebrate is when you're actually engaged in your new habit.
