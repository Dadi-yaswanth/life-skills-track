# Listening and Active Communication

- use door openers and ask follow-up questions.
- Take notes if necessary in business conversations.

# 2. Reflective Listening

Reflective listening is hearing and understanding, and then letting the other know that he or she is being heard and understood.

- Think from the speaker's point of view.

- Reflect the message back to the speaker. 
- Let the speaker know you've understood them.

# 3. Reflection
#### What are the obstacles in your listening process?
