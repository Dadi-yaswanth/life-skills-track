## How to Learn Faster with the Feynman Technique

**1. What is the Feynman Technique?**
According to Feynman the best way to learn a concept is to teach it to someone else in simple terms. This helps you identify any gaps in your knowledge and reinforces your understanding of the concept.

This technique has 4 steps:

**Step 1:**
 -  Choose a topic that you want to learn.
 - Write the topic name on top of the paper.
 
 **Step 2:**
 -  Explain your topic as teachers do on the blackboard.
 -  Use simple language to explain.
 - Try to generalize things with practical examples.
 
  **Step 3:**
 - Figure out where you missing your command over the topic.
 -  Go back and revise the resources.
 
   **Step 4:**
 - Explain again and be solid in all topics.
 - Keep an eye on where you're using complicated terms.
 - Try to brake those again into simple things and repeat them till you are perfect.
 
 **2. What are the different ways to implement this technique in your learning process?**

 - Test it on me while learning. 
 - Practice this technique by mirror practice.
 - Explain to friends using simple analogies.
 - Simplify further or relate concepts with general examples.

**3. Paraphrase the video **in detail** in your own words.**
The video introduces the concept of **"learning how to learn,"** which is a powerful tool for improving one's ability to learn effectively. Our brain is complex. We can simplify fundamentally into two modes.

**Focus Mode:**
Turn focus and attention to the task.

**Diffuse Mode :**
Relax mode of the brain where random thoughts come and go.

 When learning or problem-solving, begin with focused mode. If you get stuck, switch to diffuse mode and let your mind work in the background.
Then return to focused mode and incorporate any new ideas you generated during diffuse mode into the task.


**What is pomodor technique?**

When there is a new or big task to complete, many people will postpone it which is called procrastination. This procrastination will cause serious problems in our life unknowingly. 
If you are procrastinating tasks then try the Pomodoro technique in your task.

 - Grab a timer and set it for 25 minutes.
 - No distractions and disturbances.
 - Work with full attention and focus
 - After 25 minutes, take a small break and relax
 - Repeat all steps till you are done with the task.
 
**4. What are some of the steps that you can take to improve your learning process?**
- Practicing the techniques daily.
- switching mode to diffused when getting stuck.
- Trying Pomodoro when working for long hours.
- Doing again and again until the solution plays like a song in Brain.

# Learn Anything in 20 hours
**5. Your key takeaways from the video? Paraphrase your understanding.**
These are steps to learn the skill faster :

**Step 1: Deconstruct the logic**
 - Decide what you want to do with that skill after learning.
 - A skill means a bundle of capable things. So brake them into small pieces.
 - From small pieces learn which you feel is important for you.

**Step 2: Learn enough to self-correct**
 - Grab 2 or 3 resources for learning skill and practice with what you have learned.
 - Notice mistakes in practice and self-correct them.

**Step 3: Remove practice barriers**
 - Avoid mobile, tv, and whatever distracts you.
 - Stay focused and confident.

**Step 4: Practice at least 20 hours**
 - Avoid initial frustration and keep going.
 - Be consistent to improve and make progress.

**6. What are some of the steps that you can while approaching a new topic?**

 - Deconstruct the topic before starting.
- Practice, self-correct, and self-edit.
- Be consistent, and avoid distractions.
- Avoiding initial barriers and frustrations.
